// K6 Grouping Feature Exercise Task Definition

// Task Definition
// The purpose of this exercise is to understand and utilize the grouping feature in k6 to organize and segment test results. Participants will create a test script that uses groups and then verify the results by analyzing the JSON output.

// Steps
// 1. Script Creation:
// - Write a k6 script that includes multiple groups.
// - Each group should contain one or more HTTP requests to a target endpoint.
// - Add different names for each group to make them identifiable.
// 2. Execution:
// - Execute the k6 script from the command line.
// - Save the output in JSON format using the --out json= flag.
// 3. JSON Verification:
// - Open the generated JSON output file.
// - Inspect the structure to locate the group-related data.
// - Verify that the groups are correctly represented with their corresponding metrics and request details.
